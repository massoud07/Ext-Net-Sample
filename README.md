# Ext-Net-Sample
Broken Ext Net Sample

This is a sample Ext.Net project showing a problem with border layout including a google maps panel.

To reproduce the problem, simply play with the collapse toggles of the panels until they break. Sometimes this happens immediately,
other times it takes a few tries.
